# OpenAsar
**Open-source**, **rewritten** version of Discord desktop's `app.asar`. OpenAsar is **not** trying to be a 1 on 1 copy or have parity with the original, it should be an **alternative**.

## Goals
- **Hotpluggable** - just swap the asar file, nothing else needed
- **Lightweight** - it should be at least as fast or lightweight, hopefully more
- **No Tracking** - no crash reporting, etc
