# OpenAsar
**Open-source alternative of Discord desktop's `app.asar`**

## Goals
- **Hotpluggable** - just swap the asar file, nothing else needed
- **Lightweight** - it should be at least as fast or lightweight, hopefully more
- **No Tracking** - no crash reporting, etc
- **Minimal** - generally only doing what is needed (see: implementation)

## Implementation
Below is a list in order of priority, marked as complete when finished:
- [ ] Stub everything
- [ ] Bootstrapping
- [ ] Splash screen
- [ ] Auto start
- [ ] Updating
  - [ ] Updater v1
  - [ ] Updater v2
